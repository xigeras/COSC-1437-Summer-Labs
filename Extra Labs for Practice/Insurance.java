/*
 * The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the customer turns in the current calendar year. 
 * The premium is computed by taking the decade of the customerâ€™s age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20. 
 * For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated by adding the decades (3) to 15 and then multiplying by 20. 
 * Write an application that prompts a user for the current year and a birth year. 
 * Pass both to a method that calculates and returns the premium amount, and then display the returned amount. 
 * Save the application as Insurance.java.
