/*
 * Create an application named Percentages whose main() method holds two double variables, and prompt the user for values. 
 * Pass both variables to a method named computePercent() that displays the two values and the value of the 
 * first number as a percentage of the second one. 
 * For example, if the numbers are 2.0 and 5.0, the method should display a statement similar to 2.0 is 40 percent of 5.0. 
 * Then call the method a second time, passing the values in reverse order. Save the application as Percentages.java.
