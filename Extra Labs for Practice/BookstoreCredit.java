/*
 * To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each student a bookstore credit that is 10 times the student’s grade point average. 
 * In other words, a student with a 3.2 grade point average receives a $32 credit. 
 * Create a class that prompts a student for a name and grade point average and then passes the values to a 
 * method that displays a descriptive message. 
 * The message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit. 
 * Save the application as BookstoreCredit.java.
