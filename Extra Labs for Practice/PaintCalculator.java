/*
 * Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. 
 * Create an application with a main() method that prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a rectangular room. 
 * Pass these three values to a method that does the following:

    - Calculates the wall area for a room
    - Passes the calculated wall area to another method that calculates and returns the number of gallons of paint needed
    - Displays the number of gallons needed
    - Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that the painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a whole gallon
    - Returns the price to the main() method

The main() method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a 15-by-20-foot room with 10-foot ceilings is $64. 
Save the application as PaintCalculator.java.
