/*
 * The Renew Your Home Company estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, 
 * plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site. 
 * Create a class that contains a main() method that prompts the user for the name of a job 
 * (for example, Patel bathroom remodel), the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours of travel time. 
 * Pass the numeric data to a method that computes an estimate for the job and returns the 
 * computed value to the main() method, where the job name and estimated price are displayed. 
 * Save the program as JobPricing.java.
