 * Write a program for Horizon Phones, a provider of cellular phone service. 
 * Prompt a user for maximum monthly values for talk minutes needed, text messages needed, and 
 * gigabytes of data needed, and then display a recommendation for the best plan for the customerâ€™s needs. 
 * A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and no text or data should buy Plan A at $49 per month. 
 * A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and any text messages should buy Plan B at $55 per month. 
 * A customer who needs 500 or more minutes of talk and no data should buy either Plan C for up to 100 text messages at $61 per month 
 * or Plan D for 100 text messages or more at $70 per month. 
 * A customer who needs any data should buy Plan E for up to 3 gigabytes at $79 per month or Plan F for 3 gigabytes or more at 
 * $87 per month.
