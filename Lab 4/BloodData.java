/*
 * Create a class named BloodData that includes String fields that hold a blood type 
 * (the four blood types are O, A, B, and AB) and an Rh factor (the factors are + and â€“). 
 * Create a default constructor that sets the fields to O and + and an overloaded constructor that requires values for both fields. 
 * Include get and set methods for each field. Save this file as BloodData.java.
