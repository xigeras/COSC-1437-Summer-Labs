/*
 * Create an application named TestBloodData that declares two objects. 
 * Prompt the user for values for one, and use the default constructor values for the other. 
 * Display the details of both objects. 
 * Then change the values in the default object so it uses the userâ€™s values, and 
 * display the details for the object again to confirm the changes are made correctly. 
 * Save the application as TestBloodData.java.
