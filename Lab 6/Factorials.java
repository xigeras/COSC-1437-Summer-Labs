/*
 * Write an application that displays the factorial for every integer value from 1 to a user-entered limit. 
 * A factorial of a number is the product of that number multiplied by each positive integer lower than it. 
 * For example, 4 factorial is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 24. 
 * (You can use the int data type for the factorial, but if you enter a number greater than 16, 
 * the results will be unexpected because the factorial value exceeds the largest value that can be stored in an int.) 
 * Save the file as Factorials.java.
